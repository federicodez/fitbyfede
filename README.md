# Fitness application to keep track of your workouts and progress.

#Why?
I created this app because I was tired of adding my workouts to my phones notes app. Notes app is just not made for workout tracking. Each time I wanted to add a new workout, I would have to scroll all the way down to my latest workout. And if your like me, working out nearly everyday, those workouts pile up, so that's a lot of scrolling down.
